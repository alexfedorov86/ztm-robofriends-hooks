# Getting Started with ZTM Robofriends (Hooks edition)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is part of ZTM Academy [Web Development Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

The basic version (using classes) on github: [ztm-robofriends](https://github.com/alexfedorov86/ztm-robofriends)

**In this edition classes are replaced with hooks.**

## Step-by-step guide

### Create new repository

1. Clone base application  
`git clone https://github.com/alexfedorov86/ztm-robofriends ztm-robofriends-hooks`  
Clone initial repository to new local folder

`npm install`  
Install all dependencies

! Probably we get some vulnerabilities we need to fix.

`npm update`  
`npm audit fix`  
To update libraries and fix any issues

`npm start` Check if all works  

2. Create new app on github, link local project to it and push

On github new app "ztm-robofriends-hooks" created.

`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/alexfedorov86/ztm-robofriends-hooks.git`  
existing "origin" remote URL updated

`git add`  
`git commit -m "project copied and ready to be modified"`  
`git push`
